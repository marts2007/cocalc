There is a special case that is unavoidable without making the
plain text file really ugly.     If you type "foo " in slate (with the space),
this converts to "foo " in Markdown (*with* the space).  But
markdown-it converts this back to [...{text:"foo"}]
without the space at the end of the line!  Without modifying
how we apply diffs, the only solution to this problem would
be to emit "foo&#32;" which technically works, but is REALLY ugly.
So if we do not do the following operation in some cases
when the path is to the focused cursor.

  {type: "remove_text", text:"[whitespace]", path, offset}

NOTE: not doing this transform doesn't mess up paths of
subsequent ops since all this did was change some whitespace
in a single text node, hence doesn't mutate any paths.

Similarly we do not delete empty paragraphs if the cursor
is in it.  This comes up when moving the cursor next to voids,
where we have to make an empty paragraph to make it possible to
type something there (e.g., between two code blocks).
