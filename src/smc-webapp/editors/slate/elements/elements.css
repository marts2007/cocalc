CSS to handle tight/nontight lists.

ALSO, importantly, we handle the fact that lists in slate end up
getting entries somewhat renadomly wrapped in paragraphs or not.
When the markdown is loaded everything is wrapped in paragraphs;
however, when creating new lines, they might not be. We might
change/fix this, but in any case it's nice to be able to ensure
things don't look all wrong by getting rid of the paragraph margin
inside of lists. Also, eliminating this paragraph margin means we
don't have to compensate for it using negative margins.
