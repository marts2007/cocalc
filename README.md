#### _Collaborative Calculation and Data Science_

**CoCalc** is a virtual online workspace for calculations, research, collaboration and authoring documents.
This includes working with the full scientific Python stack, [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org),
[Julia](https://julialang.org), [R Statistics](https://cocalc.com/doc/r-statistical-software.html),
[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), and many more.
It also offers capabilities to author documents in [LaTeX](https://cocalc.com/doc/latex-editor.html), R/knitr or Markdown,

## History

_CoCalc_ was formerly called _SageMathCloud_.
It started to offer way more than just SageMath and hence outgrew itself.
The name was coined in fall 2016 and changed around spring 2017.
